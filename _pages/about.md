Hello, World! ðŸ‘‹

This personal website acts as a portfolio, online resume and blog.
While posts will be scarce and written mainly for my own reference, I would be glad to hear if someone else finds them useful.
Topics discussed include, but are not limited to, personal interests such as Programming Languages (Theory, Design and Implementation), Videogame Development, Cybersecurity, Computer Architecture and Historic Swordsmanship.
