I'm a Computer Scientist from [UFSC](https://cco.ufsc.br), with an exchange year focused on Embedded Systems Engineering at [Ensimag](https://ensimag.grenoble-inp.fr/en/education/embedded-systems-and-software-devices).
Formerly a research assistant at UFSC's Embedded Computing Lab. ([ECL](https://eclab.paginas.ufsc.br)), specifically in the Video Coding research team; I was also part of a small project at [Verimag](https://www-verimag.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr), which was dedicated to the Simulation and Formal Verification of Self-stabilizing Algorithms.
My Technical Degree from [IFSC](http://sites.florianopolis.ifsc.edu.br/eletronica) also makes me an Electronics Technician, with some experience dealing with high voltage static converters.
