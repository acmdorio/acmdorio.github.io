I am a Computer Science BSc student at the Department of Computer Science and Statistics ([INE][ine]) of Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina ([UFSC][ufsc]).
My current research activities are related to Video Coding techniques and are being conducted at UFSC's Embedded Computing Laboratory ([ECL][ecl]).
I also have a background in Electronics due to a Professional/Technical Course at Instituto Federal de Santa Catarina ([IFSC][ifsc]) including experience dealing with High Voltage Static Converters.

This personal website acts as a CV, portfolio and blog.
Posts will be scarce and written mainly for my own reference, but I would be glad to hear if someone else finds them useful.
Topics discussed include, but are not limited to, personal interests such as Generic Programming, Programming Language Design & Implementation, Advanced Game Programming Techniques, Computer Architecture and Historic Swordsmanship.
