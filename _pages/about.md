I am a BSc student at the Department of Computer Science and Statistics (INE) of Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina (UFSC).
My current research activities are related to Video Coding techniques and are being conducted at UFSC's Embedded Computing Laboratory (ECL).
I also have a background in Electronics due to a Professional/Technical Course at Instituto Federal de Santa Catarina (IFSC) including experience dealing with High Voltage Static Converters.

This personal website acts as a CV, portfolio and blog.
Posts will be scarce and written mainly for my own reference, but I would be glad to hear if someone else finds them useful.
Topics discussed include, but are not limited to, personal interests such as Generic Programming, Programming Language Design & Implementation, Advanced Game Programming Techniques, Computer Architecture and Historic Swordsmanship.
