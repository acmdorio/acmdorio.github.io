I am a Computer Science BSc student at the Department of Computer Science and Statistics ([INE](https://ine.ufsc.br/)) of Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina ([UFSC](https://ufsc.br/)).
My current research activities are related to Video Coding techniques and are being conducted at UFSC's Embedded Computing Laboratory ([ECL](https://eclab.paginas.ufsc.br/)).
I also have a background in Electronics due to a Professional/Technical Course at Instituto Federal de Santa Catarina ([IFSC](http://florianopolis.ifsc.edu.br/)) including experience dealing with High Voltage Static Converters.
