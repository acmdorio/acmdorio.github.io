This personal website acts as a CV, portfolio and blog.
Posts will be scarce and written mainly for my own reference, but I would be glad to hear if someone else finds them useful.
Topics discussed include, but are not limited to, personal interests such as Generic Programming, Programming Language Design & Implementation, Advanced Game Programming Techniques, Computer Architecture and Historic Swordsmanship.
