Just like every other computer science student and programmer, I've done a bit of [indie video game development](https://baioc.itch.io/) in personal projects or for game jams such as the [UFSC Game Jam](https://itch.io/jam/ufsc-game-jam-3) (I also helped organize its first editions).
This page collects some of those projects.

## 3D Modeling, Motion Capture and Transfer

## Othello against an AI

While following [Peter Norvig's "Paradigms of Artificial Intelligence Programming"](https://github.com/norvig/paip-lisp), I implemented some of the artificial Othello players described therein.
You can play against one of those AIs (or match them against each other) using the Replit that should appear below (press the green "run" button if it doesn't start automatically).

## MoonFable

[MoonFable](https://baioc.itch.io/moonfable) is a short fantasy RPG game mixing turn-based combat and Match-3 casual puzzle mechanics.
Made during the [UFSC Game Jam 3](https://itch.io/jam/ufsc-game-jam-3) using the [LÃ–VE2D framework](https://love2d.org/).
