#### [Relying on a rate constraint to reduce Motion Estimation complexity](https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP39728.2021.9414799) [[PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.09656.pdf)]
**IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)**<br>
**Abstract:** This paper proposes a rate-based candidate elimination strategy for Motion Estimation, which is considered one of the main sources of encoder complexity. We build from findings of previous works that show that selected motion vectors are generally near the predictor to propose a solution that uses the motion vector bitrate to constrain the candidate search to a subset of the original search window, resulting in less distortion computations. The proposed method is not tied to a particular search pattern, which makes it applicable to several ME strategies. The technique was tested in the VVC reference software implementation and showed complexity reductions of over 80% at the cost of an average 0.74% increase in BD-Rate with respect to the original TZ Search algorithm in the LDP configuration.
